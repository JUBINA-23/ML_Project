## Energy Consumption Data (Linear Regression)
This dataset is designed for predicting energy consumption based on various building features and environmental factors such as building types, square footage, the number of occupants, appliances used, average temperature and the day of the week. The model is useful for understanding energy demand patterns and optimizing energy consumption. The dataset was trained using different models in which a highest accuracy of 92% was predicted by the Gradient Boosting Regressor.

## Manufacturing Data (Polynomial Regression)
This report presents an analysis of a manufacturing dataset, which simulates real-world data collected from a manufacturing process. The dataset is designed to explore the relationships between various process parameters and product quality which contains feature variables that represent process conditions and a target variable that represents the quality rating of the manufactured items. The data was trained with a polynomial regression model which predicted 98.9% accuracy.

## Drugs Classification Data (Classification - Logistic Regression)
The dataset used to predict the type of drug used by the user which contains columns such as age, sex, BP, cholesterol, Na_to_K (refers to the "sodium to potassium ratio" in a human's blood) which are the factors used as features in this machine learning model to predict drug responses. Here, we use classification models and boosters to predict an accuracy of 100%.

## Loan Prediction (Classification - Random Forest)
The dataset is of loan risk assessment featuring 1000 entries exploring key factors like age, income, assets, credit score, debt-to-income ratio, existing loans and criminal records to predict loan default. The trained data was fitted to the Random Forest Classifier that predicted 100% accuracy score.

## Student Stress Factors (Classification)
This dataset contains 20 features that create the most impact on the Stress of a Student. The features are selected scientifically considering 5 major factors, they are Psychological, Physiological, Social, Environmental and Academic Factors. The data was fitted into 5 different models in which Decision Tree Classifier and Naive Bayes Gaussian Model predicts 100% accuracy.

## Instagram Visits (Clustering)
This dataset captures Instagram user's visit scores and their spending rank (on a scale of 0 to 100). The goal is to analyze and group users into distinct clusters based on their behaviors, enabling insights into user engagement and spending potential. The dataset is suitable for unsupervised machine learning techniques, which can help identify patterns and group users effectively. The data was fitted into a Clustering Model that determined the optimal number of clusters as 4 using elbow method. The model predicted a Silhouette score of 0.64 which is good, showing reasonable clustering. PCA was also applied to the data.
