## Energy Consumption Data (Linear Regression)
This dataset is designed for predicting energy consumption based on various building features and environmental factors such as building types, square footage, the number of occupants, appliances used, average temperature and the day of the week. The model is useful for understanding energy demand patterns and optimizing energy consumption. The dataset was trained using different models in which a highest accuracy of 96.8% was predicted by the Gradient Boosting Regressor.

## Manufacturing Data (Polynomial Regression)
This report presents an analysis of a manufacturing dataset, which simulates real-world data collected from a manufacturing process. The dataset is designed to explore the relationships between various process parameters and product quality which contains feature variables that represent process conditions and a target variable that represents the quality rating of the manufactured items. The data was trained with a polynomial regression model which predicted 96.8% accuracy.

## Drugs Classification Data (Classification)
### The dataset contains columns such as age, sex, BP, cholesterol, Na_to_K (refers to the "sodium to potassium ratio" in a human's blood) which are the factors used as features in this machine learning model to predict drug responses as the target is the drug used. Based on these factors, we can predict which type of drug is used by the user using classification models.
